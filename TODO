Petsc Solver Updates
1) Compare assembly of Schur complement matrix as in
   [Petsc ex70](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-current/src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex70.c.html) with direct assembly
   if this is found to dominate solver cost.

Internally straight
1) Ensure that internally straight edges are correctly treated for non-conforming meshes where non-isoparametric
geometry is used. I.e. ensure that non-conforming faces match after the linear correction.

Code Updates
1) Delete all functions in the src/testing/complex directory path.
2) Delete all headers for def_templates_*_i in containers.
