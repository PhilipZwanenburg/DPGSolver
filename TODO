Ensure that the link above is correct

grep through all files for 'ToBeModified' and 'ToBeDeleted' comments, making appropriate modifications when possible.

change tab spaces to 8 and increase max lines to check alignment of the code under different options in .vimrc

put src code into logical subfolders
check that all includes in the headers are also present in the associated .c files (for correct dependency generation)


Petsc Solver Updates
1) Assemble LHS terms directly in Petsc Mat
	- Remove memory initialization for LHS terms.
2) Assemble HDG complete and Schur complement matrix as in [Petsc ex70](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-current/src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex70.c.html)
	- Compare cost of MatMatMult with direct assembly if assembly dominates solver cost.


LHS changes:
1) Move memory allocation (calloc) to relevant compute_* functions (remove in update_VOLUME/FACE functions)
2) Free memory as soon as it is no longer needed during compute_RLHS stage (Including freeing Qhat_What**)
3) Remove dependence on global variables (when implementing HDG)
	- remove variables which are only used in certain functions of the code from currently defined global structs (e.g.
	  remove LHS, QhatV from the VOLUME struct). Replace these with new structs derived from the common VOLUME with the
	  additional required parameters for the specific functions under consideration (e.g. solving, geometry).
