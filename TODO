Petsc Solver Updates
1) Assemble LHS terms directly in Petsc Mat
	- Remove memory initialization for LHS terms.
2) Assemble HDG complete and Schur complement matrix as in [Petsc ex70](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-current/src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex70.c.html)
	- Compare cost of MatMatMult with direct assembly if assembly dominates solver cost.
