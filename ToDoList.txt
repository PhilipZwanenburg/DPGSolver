Monday:
	(Done) - Trace through the geometry coefficient portion of the code for the volume.
	(Done) - Create a NURBS patch (invscid channel bump) test case.

Tuesday:
	(Done) - Load the NURBS patch into the code by reading in the knot, order and control
		point data.
		(Done) - Print data out to ensure it has been read correctly
		- See if the control point connectivity data can be read into an existing data
			structure and, if so, transfer the data to there.
	- Generate the NURBS parametric mapping function. Compute the physical coordinate
		locations using the mapping and validate by comparing to a plot of the 
		patch.
	- Use the chain rule to compute the metric terms in the volume of the element 
		using the parametric mapping.
	- Use the chain rule to compute metric terms on the face of the element.
	- Run the NURBS bump test case and verify that the solution converges. 
		Visualize the results.

Wednesday:
	- Perform an orders convergence test to verify that the orders of accuracy hold
		for the NURBS parametric mapping case.
	- Create a NACA
	- Create the method for computing the adjoint.
		- Compute the adjoint for a target CL case objective function

Wednesday:






ToDo:
	- Create a NURBS Gaussian Bump case. So, set the bottom wall using a NURBS function
		and set the other three sides to be straight. Read the data points and form the 
		parametric mapping. For the RBF, all these points will be the surface points (the
		volume points will not be loaded from the NURBS file, they are specified on 
		the parametric domain in the GMSH file). Also, might not need RBF since the design 
		control points do not overlap (farfield, so they are really far). The parametric
		domain will ensure, through the mapping, that the elements do not have a negative
		jacobian.
