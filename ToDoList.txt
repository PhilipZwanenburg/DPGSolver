Wednesday:
	(Done) - Run a Gaussian Bump Case at only one mesh level and P and process the results
		- Trace through the setup process for the simulation and see how the code is set

Thursday:
	(Done) - Use a quad mesh instead of a mixed one for the gaussian bump and visualize the results.
	(Done) - Modify the mesh refinement of the Quad mesh and see how the results turn out. 
	- Create a NURBS mesh python generator. This mesh will need to be read into the DPG
		code. The knot range will need to be -1 to 1 in order to use the 
		parametric mapping option. Create a user_defined patch case
	- Create a NURBS Gaussian Bump case. So, set the bottom wall using a NURBS function
		and set the other three sides to be straight. Read the data points and form the 
		parametric mapping. For the RBF, all these points will be the surface points (the
		volume points will not be loaded from the NURBS file, they are specified on 
		the parametric domain in the GMSH file). Also, might not need RBF since the design 
		control points do not overlap (farfield, so they are really far). The parametric
		domain will ensure, through the mapping, that the elements do not have a negative
		jacobian.
