Thursday/Friday:
	(Done) - Run the NURBS bump test case and verify that the solution converges. 
		Visualize the results.

		- geom_coef seems to be a parameter that is used throughout the code. The issue is
			that this term is not found using the NURBS mapping. So, I am unsure of what 
			effect that is having on the solution.


	- Run an orders of accuracy test using the new metric computation with the NURBS bump
		case and see if the orders are conserved or not.

		(Done) - Run the test for the case without NURBS metrics
		
			(Done) - Convergence looked alright for superparametric mesh (isoparametric did 
				not converge)

		- Issues with NURBS metric convergence. Need to find a way to either do adaptation
			using the NURBS metrics or read a new file every time. The issue has been that
			reading a new file each time for some reason gives different results from 
			doing adaption for the non-metric case. See Philip about this.
	
	- Create a NACA 0012 airfoil patch

		- Perform a NURBS spline approximation and fit the spline around the
			the airfoil. Knot repeatedness not needed yet (will need to be done
			for the leading edge eventually). Have the spline wrap around
			from the trailing edge, under the airfoil, and back to the
			trailing edge.

		- Create the farfield as well as an o-grid. 

		- Create the gmsh file to accompany the patch.

			- Create slip wall boundary conditions at the bottom, farfield
				at the top and then periodic at the line at which the patch
				touches each other at rear of the airfoil.

		- Run the airfoil case and check whether the flow converges.







	- Create the lift coefficient objective function.

		- Compute the lift by integrating the pressure on any face that had 
			a slip wall BC. Then just sum up all the contributions. 

		- Create a real version of the function first. Then, create 
			a templated version so that the function may be called
			with complex doubles (for the adjoint computation)

	- Compute the adjoint for the lift coefficient case.

		- Use the linearization of the LHS in the code

		- Compute the linearization of the RHS by using the complex step
			- Verify using finite differences. Create a unit test 
				to verify linearization with finite differences. 
				Eventually, perhaps, compute the linearization analytically

		- Solve the adjoint using PETSc



ToDo:
	- Implement efficient NURBS mapping derivative using NURBS book 
		algorithm which gets around the use of the derivative of the
		basis functions.
	- Alternate approach of using the NURBS metric terms
		- Compute the metric terms using the NURBS mapping at the metric nodes. This will
				now form a basis that can be used to find the values at any other nodes. 
		- Issue is, how to get the geom_coef values using the metric terms.
			- Traditionally what is done: 
				- For the volume cubature nodes, we use an operator to go 
					from vm (volume metric) to vc (volume cubature). 
				- For the face, we once again interpolate from the vm (volume metric)
					to the fc (face cubature) nodes.
