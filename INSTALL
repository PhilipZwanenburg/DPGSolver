On Guillimin, either the programs can be downloaded and configured manually or the following packages can be added:

FILL ME IN.




PETSC (petsc-3.6.3)

	OpenMPI:

	0) Prerequisites based on my build (other options in brackets => not verified): 

		OpenMPI, 
		Intel MKL (Other BLAS/Lapack libraries)

	1) Download and extract .tar file.
	2) PETSC Configuration options:
		It is suggested to make two build directories, with debugging enabled/disabled.
		I was unable to build PETSC using COPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' on OSX 10.10

		./configure PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-c-debug --with-cc=mpicc --with-cxx=mpicxx --with-fc=mpif90 --with-blas-lapack-dir=/Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/intel/mkl --with-debugging=1

		./configure PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-c-opt --with-cc=mpicc --with-cxx=mpicxx --with-fc=mpif90 --with-blas-lapack-dir=/Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/intel/mkl --with-debugging=0

	3) Follow make instructions for installation and testing
	make PETSC_DIR=/Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/petsc/petsc-3.6.3 PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-c-debug all

	make PETSC_DIR=/Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/petsc/petsc-3.6.3 PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-c-debug test

	make PETSC_DIR=/Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/petsc/petsc-3.6.3 PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-c-debug streams NPMAX=2


	mpich - fewer valgrind memory leaks:

	0) Prerequisites:

		Intel MKL

	1) Download and extract .tar file.
	2) PETSC Configuration options:
		It is suggested to make two build directories, with debugging enabled/disabled.
		I was unable to build PETSC using COPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' on OSX 10.10

		./configure PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-mpich-c-debug --download-mpich --with-blas-lapack-dir=/Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/intel/mkl --with-debugging=1

		./configure PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-mpich-c-opt --download-mpich --with-blas-lapack-dir=/Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/intel/mkl --with-debugging=0

	3) Follow make instructions for installation and testing (as above with OpenMPI)


ParMETIS (parmetis-4.0.3)

	0) Prerequisites:

		MPI (either OpenMPI or mpich (used below), link appropriately)

	1) Download and extract .tar file
	2) In the top directory, modify the following parameters in the Makefile:

		debug  = 1
		prefix = /Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/parmetis_mpich/parmetis-4.0.3/build/debug/
		cc     = /Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/petsc/petsc-3.6.3/arch-darwin-mpich-c-debug/bin/mpicc
		cxx    = /Users/philipzwanenburg/Desktop/Research_Codes/Downloaded/petsc/petsc-3.6.3/arch-darwin-mpich-c-debug/bin/mpicxx

		BUILDDIR = build/debug

	3) Execute make commands

		shell: make config
		shell: make install
