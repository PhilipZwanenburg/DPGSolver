Coding style guide:

The majority of the coding style choices were selected based on the "Linux kernel coding style" guide:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle


Major exceptions:

Tabs are 4 characters. 

	Rationale:
		The only case where I have found tabs of 8 characters to be more clear than those of 4 characters is in the case
		of conditional arguments which span multiple lines. Otherwise, it was felt that the longer tabs unnecessarily
		ate into the maximum column width (see below).

The limit on the length of lines is 120 columns.

	Rationale:
		120 seemed justifiable based on the size of current terminal screens.
